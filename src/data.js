    description:
      "Brandon Sanderson is a cut above the rest when it comes to world-building and clever plots. When Vin discovers that she has incredible powers, she is recruited by a band of outlaws to topple the evil despot that has ruled for thousands of years. If you like fun characters, well-setup plot twists, and a well-thought-out magic system, you'll love the Mistborn trilogy.",

    title: "Favorite Fantasy Series",
    booktitle: "The Wheel of Time",
    description:
      "This book series is my favorite of all time. Robert Jordan does an incredible job building a fleshed out world with an exciting, continent-spanning plot. I've never cared for characters more and had a work of fiction resonate with me so personally. It's very long, but well worth it because of how that length makes the ending so much more impactful.",

    title: "Sci-Fi Recommendation",

    description:
      "This is a perfect series for anyone who wants a page-turner with an engaging plot. When Darrow O'Lykos discovers that his entire life has been a lie, he vows to tear down the foundations of the corrupt society he suffered in. Besides the excellent plot and entertaining action, Pierce Brown is great at writing interpersonal drama between the characters.",

    booktitle: "Dune",
    description:
      "My dad read the first book to me as a kid, and reading it again as a teenager was what got me back into reading. Besides meaning so much to me, the sci-fi concepts and philisophical ideas were beyond their time, and I pick up something new every time I read it. Despite the confusing lore and hard to parse prose, this series is one of the most rewarding I've read.",

    description:
      "I read this before the movie came out, and I was constantly surprised by each twist and turn within the story. As engaging as the story is, the truth behind what happened to the Osage tribe is horrifying and should be told. The third part of this book blew me away with disturbing revelations that recontextualize the role of the government in the whole story.",

      "I first read this book in high school, and it's stuck with me since. The author, Wes Moore, discovers another man with the same name that grew up near him, but is now in prison for manslaughter. In an excellent analysis of nature vs. nurture it shows how two lives can diverge and the factors that unknowingly force individuals down certain paths.",

This series may usurp The Wheel of Time as my favorite series when it is complete to give an indication of the quality. Not to mention the fourth book ended on a cliff-hanger for a long anticipated duel!",

    description:
      "I've heard so much about this series from friends, and I look forward to reading some sci-fi that is less action-oriented. It's been likened to the cleverness of Foundation, so this is definitely next on my list. I heard that this book deals with how human society reacts to the exterior forces of aliens and how those aliens have been manipulating us. Sounds interesting!",
